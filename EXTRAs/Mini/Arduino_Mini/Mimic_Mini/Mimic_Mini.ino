     In theory the internal oscillator (clock) is 25MHz but it really isn't
     that precise. You can 'calibrate' this by tweaking this number until
     you get the PWM update frequency you're expecting!
     The int.osc. for the PCA9685 chip is a range between about 23-27MHz and
     is used for calculating things like writeMicroseconds()
     Analog servos run at ~50 Hz updates, It is importaint to use an
     oscilloscope in setting the int.osc frequency for the I2C PCA9685 chip.
     1) Attach the oscilloscope to one of the PWM signal pins and ground on
        the I2C PCA9685 chip you are setting the value for.
     2) Adjust setOscillatorFrequency() until the PWM update frequency is the
        expected value (50Hz for most ESCs)
     Setting the value here is specific to each individual I2C PCA9685 chip and
     affects the calculations for the PWM update frequency.
     Failure to correctly set the int.osc value will cause unexpected PWM results
